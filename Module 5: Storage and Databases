Module 5: Storage and Databases
  Objectives:
      concepts of storage and databases, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Storage Service,
      Amazon Elastic File System, Amazon Relational Database Service, Amazon Dynamo DB, summary
  
--  
Instance stores and Amazon Elastic Block Store:
    Block level storage - a place to store files. Cubby system
      Ex: Databases, Enterprise software, File systems
      
In a normal EC2 instance you have the hypervisor aws host and store volumes harddrive
  that is physically attached to host computer but this data is deleted when you stop running 
  your instance

EBS allows for backups of data called snapshots, only changed data is added
EBS you define confiugrations settings like volume, size and type. You can provision it. 
You can attach it to an EC2 instance

Amazon Simple Storage Service:
  Allows you to store and retrieve unlimited data
  Store data as objects. Each object contains data, metadata and a key
  Store objects in buckets
  Max object size is 5 TB
  Versionobjects of papertrail
  Create multiple permission objects
  Anytime there is a change to the object, you must re upload the entire file
  
  Tiered stored objects 
    First Tier - S3 Standard - Super reliable durability. Can sustain concurrent loss of data
                 S3 Standard Static Website
    Second tier - S3 Standard Infrequent Acces (Standard-IA) - Less frequent but rapidly retreivable
    Third tier - Amazon S3 Glacier longterm slowly retrievable data. Vaults and archives
                 Vault lock term. Can configure specific policys like Write once and Read many (WORM)
   life cycle policy to automatically transfer data to glacier after x days 
   
   
   Block Stoage Service     versus        Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
                        
   Size up to: 16 TiB                           Unlimited storage, each object 5tb
   Survive termination of EC2                   Write once, read many
   Solid State by default                       99.9999 durable
   HDD options                                  Web enabled
   Block micro change friendly                  Regionally distributed
                                                Offers cost savings
                                                Serverless
   
   
   Amazon Elastic File System (EFS):
      Regional service
      Stores data in and across multiple availability zones
      Used with AWS cloud services and on premises resources
      Allows for multiple instances accessing the data in EFS at the same time
      Autoscales as needed
  
  
  Amazon Relational Database (RDS)
