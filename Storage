There are three main types of storage

  Block
      Where data is written as individual pieces to a storage device.
      Block storage files, are divided into blocks and written directly to empty blocks
      on a physical drive. Each block is assigned a unique identifier and then written to
      the disk in the most efficient manner possible. Since blocks are assigned identifiers, 
      they do not need to be stored in adjacent sections of the disk. Indeed they can be spread 
      across multiple disks or environments. You can retrieve the individual blocks separately 
      from the rest of the file, which makes block storage excellent for technology like 
      relational databases
  File
      Is a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories.
      operating systems save data in hierarchical file systems organized in the
      form of directories, sub-directories and files, or folders, sub-folders,
      and files depending on the operating system.
      
  Object
      A flat structure where data is held in a bucket.
      Object can be organized to imitate a hierarchy by attaching key name prefixes
      and delimiters. Prefixes and delimiters allow you to group similar items to help
      visually organize and easily retrieve your data. In the user interface, these 
      prefixes give the appearance of a folder and subfolder structure but in reality,
      the storage is still a flat structure.
