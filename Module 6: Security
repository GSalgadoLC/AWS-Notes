Module 6: Security
    Objectives:
        Shared responsibility model, multi-factor authethication, aws identity, aws access management, main benefits of aws 
        organizations, security policies, benefits of compliance with aws, and other best practices
        
Shared responsibilty model

    Customer : Customer data like : Platform, applications, identity and access management
                                    Operating system, network and firewall configuration
                                    Client side data encryption, server side de, network traffic protection
                                    
    AWS: Foundation services like:  Compute, Storage, Database, netowrking
                                    AWS global infrastructure, regions, edge locations and availability zones
                                    Hypervisor, netowrk, physical
                                    
User permissions and access:

    Account root user administrator / owner - access and control any resources
        -Multifactor Authethication for an additional layer
    Permissioned access using AWS Identity and Access Management
        -IAM user, has default of no permissions
        -Explicit permission of any action
        -Least priviledge principle
        -IAM policies JSON doc of allowable api calls of user
    Best practice to use IAM groups or classes
    IAM roles - have associated permissions that give permissions for a temporary amount of time.
    
    
AWS Organizations
    -Separtions of accounts
    -Centralized management
    -Consolidated billing - bulk discounts
    -Hierarchical groupings of accounts 
        ex:regulatory requirement accounts
    -AWS service and API actions access control
    
    
Compliance    
    Standards and requirements
      Ex: USA Healthcare HIPPA requirements or EU data requirements
    Inherit aws pre built compliant infrastructure  
    
AWS Artifact provides on demand secuirty and compliance reports and select online agreements. Consists of two main sections
AWS Artifact Agreements and AWS Artifact Reports

Artifact: compliance reports on demand, review, accept and manage agreements
Customer Compliance Center

    
Denial of Service Attacks   
    DDOS - Distributed denial of service. Attack on infrastructure
    Sends overwhelming requests to infrastructure of application. Leveraging several computers or bots
    
    Attack UDP FLOOD: Redirection of server response 
    Attack HTTP: Complex and attention needy searches
    Attack SLOWLORIS: Taking forever at checkout due to a faked slow connection. Production server in standby
    
    Solutions 
        security groups allowing only specific traffic
        Elastic load balancing handing http traffic 
        
      AWS Shield - standard malicious attacks
        Free no cost
        Attackers signatures
        
      AWS Shiled Advanced
        Paid service that provides detailed diagnotics and ability to detect and mitigate sophisticated DdOs attacks
        Integrates with other services as well
