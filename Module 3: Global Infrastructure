Module 3: Global Infrastructure and Reliability

Objectives: Learn about the infrastructure, availability zones, cloudfront, edge locations, comparing differenet methods for provisioning aws services

High availability and fault tolerance

Global Infrastructure:
    AWS Regions are isolated entirely from other regions. Customer can choose which region to connect to
    ex:regulations requiring data to remain in a certain location. Regional data soverignty
    
    Distance between usage and datacenter can affect thse latency of service
    Feature availability may also be a factor, not all regions will support all services
    Pricing may differ per region
    
Each region has many availability zones that are composed of many datacenters

Edge Locations
  Customers in Mumbai but data in tokyo. You can cache via a content delivery network cdn
  AWS cdn is CloudFront, low latency and high transfer speeds
  Uses edge locations are separate from regions. They run cloudfron and also domain name service such as amazon route 53
  AWS outposts will install a mini region inside a private datacenter building
  
API is how to interact with aws services
  Application programming interface
  
Methods to interact are
  AWS management console
    Browser based. Test environments. Bills. Monitoring. 
  AWS Command Line Interface
    Production ready. Scripts.. Automaton
  AWS Software development kits
    Programs without using low level apis
  Other tools
  
 Provisioning a resource
  Log in to management console
  Write commands
  
  
Elastic Beanstalk
    Provide application code and desired confiugrations and beanstalk will create enviroment 
    Manages adjustable capacity, load balancing, automatic scaling and health monitoring
    
 CloudFormation
    Treat your infrastructure as code. No need to perform manual actions
    Determines the right operations to perform when managing your stack and rolls back changes automatically if an error is detected
