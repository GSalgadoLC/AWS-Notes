Module 4: Networking

Objectives: Concepts of networking, public vs private networks, virtual private gateways, virtual private networks,
            AWS Direct Connect, benefits of hybrid deployment, layers of security in IT, interaction of customers with 
            aws services
            
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
  Public and private subnets
  Coffee shop example the public is the cashier and the barista is the private.

Connectivity to AWS

Public traffic --> -Internet gateway Estic load balancer --> 
                     Private or        [ Auto Scaling [ Security (EC2 Instances) ]]
                                                                      [ Security ( Database) ]
                                                                                             ]
Internet gateway. Virtual private gateway via a virtual private network. Use public road but with a bodyguard
Subnet - A section of a VPC that can contain resources such as amazon ec2 instances
AWS Direct connect can act like a private magic backdoor that will only allow people you want to give access
Private connection from a datacenter

Subnets and network access control lists

Security
  Network hardening 
  Application security
  User identity
  Authorization and Authetication
  DDOS prevention
  Data integrity
  Encryption

Model
      Packet --> Network access  [   [subnet]   ]
                 Control list
  
  NACL checks credentials if they have access. Permission to go in and out.
    ex: checks vip list at the subnet level
        Default allows all innbound and outbound traffic
  Security group can allow specific types of requests like allow web traffic, checks in and not out
    ex: allows specfic traffic types inside an ec2 instance
        Default is to deny all inbound and allow all outbound and is stateful
        
  Stateful vs stateless engines of security groups and Network access control lists
  
  Private subnet- isolates databases containing customers personal info
  Virtual private gateway - Create a VPC connection between the VPC and the internal corporate network
  Public Subnet - Support customer facing traffic
  AWS Direct Connect - Establish a dedicated connection between the on-premise data center and the VPC
  
Global Networking:
    Route 53 Domain Name Service:
      Translation of website names to IP Addresses and routes to it
      
      -Latency based routing
      -Geolocation DNS
      -Geoproximity routing
      -Weighted round robin
      
    CloudFront - Content delivery network

Summary:
  -Structuring and connecting to a VPC
  -Securing VPC resources with NACLs and Security groups
  -Using route 53 and CloudFront
