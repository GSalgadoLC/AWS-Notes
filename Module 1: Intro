#Overview. Cloud concepts, AWS services, security, architecture, pricing and support

#Module 1 Introduction
  Objectives
    Benefits of AWS, on demand delivery and cloud deployments, pricing models
  Services 
    Compute, storage, network security, blockchain, ML, AI, Robot development, video production....
   Cloud Compute
    Client - Server Model
    Customer requests - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance (server) EC2
    Validation and response by server. Multiple requests and increased complexity in real world
   Pay per usage:
    Capacity solutions per demand
   Cloud
    On demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing
    
    Cloud based deployment
      Migrate existing applications to the cloud or design and build new applications in the cloud
      Applications can be low level requiring IT staff to manage or high level automated
      ex: virtual servers, databases and networking components fully based in the cloud
    
    On-Premise Deployment
      Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
      Private cloud deployment
      Tech running on private data center with incorporation of application management and other virtualization technologies to help increase resource utilization
      
    Hybrid Deployment
      Connect cloud based resources to on premise infrastructure
      Integrate cloud based resources with legacy it applications
      ex: legacy applications that are better maintained on premise. Requirement to keep records on premise
      ex: A company that wants to use cloud services like automating batch data for processing and analytics. That data perhaps is part of its legacy applications 
          that will remain on premise but still benefit from cloud services
          
Benefits of cloud computing
  Trade upfront expense for variable expense
    Buying infrastructure like a data center and its physical components is expensive, vs paying per usage on the cloud
  Maintenance and running costs of a data center
  Capacity on demand versus estimation 
  AWS economies of scale pricing
  Increased speed and agility of resources and services
